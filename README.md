# Speech Model Fine-tuning Project

This project demonstrates speech model training and fine-tuning capabilities using the Whisper model architecture. It's designed to be run in cloud environments like Google Colab to avoid local disk space limitations.

## Project Overview

This project showcases:
- Fine-tuning pre-trained speech models on custom datasets
- Working with speech data (LibriSpeech dataset)
- Implementation in PyTorch and Python
- Deep learning foundations for speech recognition
- Experience with large datasets
- Evaluation using industry-standard metrics (WER, CER)
- MLOps considerations for model deployment
